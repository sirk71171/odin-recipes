A project about a recipe, in particular, chicken alfredo penne. I intend to use this project as a measure of my ability to implement what I have learned throughout the Odin Project thus far. That is, I wish to demonstrate the ability to
 
 1. Create a github repository, use git as a VCS throughout the project, and commit when appropriate with just right messages.
 2. Create boilerplate. Know how to implement it without using the !.
 3. Set a title.
 4. Use headings when needed and according to their respective level.
 5. Create links.
 6. Input images using the discussed standards. 
 7. Use the appropriate list(s) for the project.
